# Java Code Examples - Recursion and Complexity Questions

This repository contains a collection of Java code examples focusing on recursion and complexity questions. The code is written in a somewhat messy manner as it was initially created for personal usage. However, it may still serve as a valuable resource for learning and reference.

## Table of Contents

1. **Array and String Manipulation**
    - `isSum`: Check if a sum can be achieved using elements of an array.
    - `shortestRoad`: Find the shortest path between two arrays.
    - `longestPalindrome`: Find the length of the longest palindrome subsequence.
    - `isPalindrome`: Check if an array is a palindrome.
    - `missingValue`: Find the missing number from a series.
    - `howManySorted`: Count the number of sorted sequences.

2. **Matrix and Boolean Operations**
    - `cntTrueReg`: Count the number of true regions in a boolean matrix.
    - `Range`: Utility class for working with ranges.
    - `edit`: Calculate the minimum number of edits to convert one string to another.
    - `countTriplets`: Count triplets with a given sum in an array.
    - `crossSearch` and `crossSort`: Search and sort an array using cross patterns.

3. **Dynamic Programming and Recursion**
    - `printPathWeights`: Print the maximum path weight in a 2D array.
    - `isIdentity`: Check if a given element is part of the identity matrix.
    - `maxMatrix`: Find the maximum value in a matrix.
    - `printExpr`: Print an expression with given values and operators.
    - `cheapestRoute`: Find the cheapest route in a given array.
    - `sortMod`: Sort an array with a given modulus.

4. **Search and Sorting Algorithms**
    - `returnToSortArray`: Transform an array to a sorted state.
    - `findSum`: Check if a sum can be achieved using elements of an array.
    - `cover`: Check if a given array can cover a matrix.
    - `ways`: Find the number of ways to choose elements from a set.

5. **Miscellaneous**
    - `oneFiveSeven`: Count the number of ways to express a number as the sum of 1, 5, and 7.

## Note
This codebase primarily focuses on recursion and complexity questions. The organization of the code is not optimal due to its initial creation for personal usage. Despite its messy structure, it may still be beneficial for those interested in exploring recursion and complexity concepts in Java.
